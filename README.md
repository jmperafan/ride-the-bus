<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmperafan/">Juan Manuel Perafan</a></p>

Ride the Bus is a drinking game that requires a combination of luck and logic in order to not get completely wasted after the first game - guess correct or drink! I decided to make a Python version of this game to practice my programming skills.

### Current Release
My idea is to expand this game beyond the first 4 rounds and add a graphical interphase. For now, I have only build the first 4 rounds.
